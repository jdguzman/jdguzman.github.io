          <p>
            Worked on various legislative products built with Ruby on Rails. The products required working with large amounts of data collected on a nightly basis. We used Solr for searching and Redis as our cache store. Mysql was the database used to store all the data. I was responsible for developing and architecting the final phase of our single state legislative product.
