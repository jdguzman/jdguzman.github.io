        A results driven and motivated developer with proven track record of
        developing applications for complex problem domains, and deploying them
        into production.  With an excellent grasp of programming principles the
        resulting work is crafted with attention to detail and maintainability
        in mind.  As a polyglot programmer I enjoy using my knowledge of
        different language conventions to build solutions.
