        Working as a freelance developer I have strived to learn something new everyday.  With over 7 years of experience I have worked with several languages and am always looking to learn more.  Currently I am working through a Haskell book trying to learn the idioms behind functional programming.

        I enjoying reading, particularly on the subjects of philosophy, science and technology.  I have a deep interest in the way the world works and how we interpret it. I also love music and play several instruments.  Music, I find, offers me a great escape from the world of code and allows me to explore a different creative side.

        I am currently working on getting back to writing.  I am in the process of restarting my blog and hope to have it up soon. It will focus on my general interests, with a focus on how we take in the world around us. A kind of philisophical blog I guess.  I will update this section once that is finished and hope that you visit it often.
